Welcome to StudentTrack, your one stop shop for all highschool student location services. With StudentTrack, you'll never lose a student again.

Tired of losing Seniors during lunch? Too many Senior skip days? Sign out and sign in too manual? Look no further.

StudentTrack will:
- Be required in order to use mobile data or wifi on a cellular device on school grounds
- Report on student location within campus during the configurable time and date period
- Alert administrative staff if a student leaves campus without permission
- Report out student traffic throughout campus allowing you to optimize scheduling for minimal traffic

*Note: This application is very much in progress and does not support the full listed features above yet. As of 2/21/2021 the application renders a list of all connected devices + allows one to view the device details and location history of the device*
